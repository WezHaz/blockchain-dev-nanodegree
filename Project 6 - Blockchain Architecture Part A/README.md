# Project #6. Blockchain Architecture Part A

## Overview

This project focuses on architectural modeling for a blockchain-based supply chain system. It documents the core workflows, states, and interactions using UML diagrams.

## Objectives

- Capture end-to-end business workflows
- Model system components and their interactions
- Define lifecycle states for supply chain assets

## Diagram descriptions

- **Activity diagram**: end-to-end process flow for asset creation, transfer, and verification.
- **Sequence diagram**: interaction order between actors (farmer, distributor, retailer, consumer) and the smart contract.
- **State diagram**: lifecycle states for a supply chain asset.
- **Class diagram**: domain model for supply chain entities and contract structure.
