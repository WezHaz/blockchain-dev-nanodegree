## Getting started

1) Pick a project folder from the list above.
2) Read the project README for prerequisites and setup steps.
3) Install dependencies within that project folder:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4) Run the project based on its README instructions (some projects are CLI-only, others are web services or dApps).

## Notes

- Project folders are self-contained and may use different dependencies or node versions.
- Some projects include compiled artifacts or diagrams that are part of submissions.
